# electron-create-react-app

Boilerplate linking [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
This boilerplate adds only one dependency - `react-router-dom` - to the list of
dependencies coming with create-react-app. Progressive web app related files
were removed.

__Many things were shamelessly copied from

for a very good background information.__
